            <h4>From the Desk of Hon’ble Minister of State’s (Independent Charge)</h4>
            <p>After Independence it was felt that there is a need to develop a pool of technicians who could supervise the work in the workshop and in the site to carry forward the First Prime Minister’s dream to develop India into an Industrial Nation.</p>
            <p>National Policy of Education (NPE), 1986 highlighted the need for strengthening the Polytechnic Education System to cater to the need of emerging industries and technologies. Under the Technician Education-II Project supported by the World Bank (IDA Credit No. 2223-IN) started in West Bengal in1992 an  investment of about Rs.142 crore was made to set-up, new courses, extensive staff development activities, Curricula were updated and revised. Workshops and Laboratories were also upgraded and modernized. Civil works were done in all the Polytechnics. AICTE started as an Advisory Body of the Ministry of Education, Government of India and was made a Statutory Body in 1987.  AICTE issued a guideline to all State Government to set-up Independent Autonomous Bodies i.e. Statutory Technical Councils. Technical Education & Training Department moved a Bill before the Legislative Assembly leading to setting-up a Statutory Council of Technical Education. West Bengal State Council of Technical Education became a Statutory Body under West Bengal Act XXI of 1995.</p>
            <p>A different Statutory body was also passed by a Legislative Bill setting up the West Bengal State Council of Vocational Education, 2005.</p>
            <p>The Hon’ble Chief Minister, Smt. Mamata Bannerjee, realised that to maximise the benefits of the existing resources and to provide the students with an integrated, appropriate, unified curriculum framework and to provide appropriate competencies in skilling of manpower of State in terms of different Trades and skills the two Councils should be subsumed to create a common resource pool which would benefit all stakeholders. Thus in 2013 in terms of West Bengal Act XXVI of 2013, the “West Bengal State Council of Technical Education” and “West Bengal State Council of Vocational Education and Training” were merged to form the “West Bengal State Council of Technical & Vocational Education & Skill Development”.</p>
            <p>The aim and objective of the Council is to study the skill gaps and develop curricula and assessment as per national standards and adopt best national and international practices for  facilitating recognition of stakeholders. To this extent the Council partners with various Industry Bodies, Chambers of Commerce for understanding of Occupational and competency standards in each sector and derive competency based training course for various job roles leading to assessment and certification.</p>
            <p>The West Bengal State Council of Technical & Vocational Education & Skill Development is endeavouring to achieve national standards by revising its curriculum according to National Standards, redefining the process of assessment to ensure probity and transparency in the process through use of technology and setting itself to National Standards and being recognised as an Awarding Body by NCVET for about 600 Vocational Courses currently being taught in West Bengal.</p>
            <p>I have full faith that the West Bengal State Council of Technical and Vocational Education and Skill Development rise to its full potential in coming days and be recognised as the best in the Country.</p>
