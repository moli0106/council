            <p>Education is complete when it makes a person competent and self-confident, to address the changes not as a threat but as an opportunity. Possessing basic skills is vital to building a person’s well rounded persona and making him/her confident in life. A successful educational system is meant to integrate technical and vocational education with the regular system of education and also make skill learning aspirational and desirable.</p>
            <p>The opening up of economy, a nation rapidly transitioning from agricultural economy to Industrial/service provider economy needs a pool of workforce who has the required level of knowledge and competence to handle these technologies.</p>
            <p>As a part of the educational ecosystem, The West Bengal State Council of Technical and Vocational Education and Skill Development considers it a huge opportunity and a responsibility to the future generation, the State and the Nation, to create through its approach and reach, a workforce that is always ahead in the learning curve of new technologies and confident to handle the challenges brought with it by technological advancement.</p>
            <p>To this end it will remain the Council’s endeavour to create course and curriculum that addresses the Industrial and technological need through an  integrated approach not only through curriculum refinement, but also opening opportunities for students through exposure visits, student exchange programmes, internships, apprenticeship opportunities and partnership with industry houses across state, nation and globally.</p>
